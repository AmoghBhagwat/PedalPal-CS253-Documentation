\subsection{Ride History Page}
\textbf{Module Details: }This module includes tests for viewing bicycle renting logs.
\\
\textbf{Test Owner: }Raghav Manglik
\\
\textbf{Test Date: }[ 26-03-2024 - 27-03-2024 ]
\\
\textbf{Test Results: }
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Test Case 1: }A user who hasn't rented bicycles before accesses the History page.
    \\
    \textbf{Result: }History Page is displayed with Total time used 0h 0m and no record of any ride.
    \item \textbf{Test Case 2: }A user while riding, that is with an active ride, accesses the History Page.
    \\
    \textbf{Result: }The History Page is displayed with information regarding past rides and no details about the active ride.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Additional Comments: }The discrepancy between the starting and ending times compared to the duration shown in the middle below the arrow arises from the system factoring in seconds in its calculation.

\subsection{My Booking Page}
\textbf{Module Details: }This module includes tests for accessing logs for both past bicycle bookings and currently active bookings.
\\
\textbf{Test Owner: }Raghav Manglik
\\
\textbf{Test Date: }[ 26-03-2024 - 27-03-2024 ]
\\
\textbf{Test Results: }
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Test Case 1: }An unsubscribed user accesses My Bookings page, a subscription required service.
    \\
    \textbf{Result: }My Bookings Page is displayed with both Current and Past Bookings as 0.
    \item \textbf{Test Case 2: }A user who hasn't booked any bicycle before accesses My Bookings page.
    \\
    \textbf{Result: }My Bookings Page is displayed with both Current and Past Bookings as 0.
    \item \textbf{Test Case 3: }A Bicycle is booked for a finite time and My Bookings Page is accessed.
    \\
    \textbf{Result: }My bookings page is displayed with current bookings incremented and showing the details about the booking. Initially, The bicycle remained in Current Bookings section once the booking period expired. This was subsequentially rectified as once the booking period expired, The bicycle moved to Past Bookings section.

\end{itemize}
\textbf{Additional Comments: }The discrepancy between the starting and ending times of the booking compared to the duration shown arises from the system factoring in seconds in its calculation.

\subsection{View Profile Page and Subscribe}
\textbf{Module Details: }This module includes tests for accessing information about a user.
\\
\textbf{Test Owner: }Raghav Manglik
\\
\textbf{Test Date: }[ 26-03-2024 - 27-03-2024 ]

If the user is not subscribed, an additional button is displayed on their Profile Page to navigate to the subscription option. Clicking this button opens the Razorpay payment gateway, which charges Rs.100. Out of this amount, Rs.80 is added to the user's wallet, and Rs.20 is deducted as the subscription fee.
    \item \textbf{Test Case 2: }A user attempts to change their profile picture by clicking on a camera icon beside the profile picture.

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
\subsubsection{Performance Requirements}
\textbf{Test Owner: }Amogh Bhagwat\\
\textbf{Date: }30/03/2024\\
\textbf{Test Description: }This test case is used to check the response time of the backend server.\\
\textbf{Test Results: }The response time of the backend server APIs is less than 1 second.\\

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{unit_testing_codes/load_testing.png}
\end{center}
\textbf{Additional Comments: }The response time of the backend server APIs is less than 1 second only when the server is already active. Since we are using Vercel's free plan,  the server goes to sleep after 5 minutes of inactivity. The first request after the server wakes up takes around 10-30 seconds.

\subsubsection{Security Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep 0em
    \item All user passwords are encrypted before storing them in the database. The user's password is never stored in plain text.
    \item All payments are done through Razorpay's secure payment gateway.
    \item All API calls between frontend and backend are authenticated using JWT tokens, and are encrypted using HTTPS.
\end{itemize}
