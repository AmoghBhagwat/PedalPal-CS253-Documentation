\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Product Scope}
Many individuals, from students to faculties, have embraced the lifestyle of cycling at the IITK campus. These cycles require timely maintenance and often get lost. A large number of lost cycles are never found by the owners and remain stacked like waste. Considering the temporary stay of students on campus, buying new cycles is not very cost-effective in such cases. In addition to that, during fests and other campus events, visitors from outside generally face problems in roaming around our huge campus.

This calls for a need for public cycle stands, from where the cycles can be rented using our  software application. These cycle stands will be located at some of the most visited locations on campus, which can be accessed through our portal, making the transport easier. Specifying the location will inform them about the nearest stands along with the number of available cycles in it.
It will also schedule maintenance on a regular basis, taking a record of the clientâ€™s feedback. The app will keep track of the duration for which the cycle is used by the client and charge accordingly. We will also provide cycle booking facilities
