\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Product Scope}
Many individuals, from students to faculties, have embraced the lifestyle of cycling at the IITK campus. These cycles require timely maintenance and often get lost. A large number of lost cycles are never found by the owners and remain stacked like waste. Considering the temporary stay of students on campus, buying new cycles is not very cost-effective in such cases. In addition to that, during fests and other campus events, visitors from outside generally face problems in roaming around our huge campus.

This calls for a need for public cycle stands, from where the cycles can be rented using our  software application. These cycle stands will be located at some of the most visited locations on campus, which can be accessed through our portal, making the transport easier. Specifying the location will inform them about the nearest stands along with the number of available cycles in it.
It will also schedule maintenance on a regular basis, taking a record of the clientâ€™s feedback. The app will keep track of the duration for which the cycle is used by the client and charge accordingly. We will also provide cycle booking facilities

    \item \textbf{Data Encryption}: All sensitive user information, including personal details and payment data, must be encrypted during transmission to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Information should be securely transmitted to the server without any changes in information. Secure storage of passwords will be done after salting and hashing the passwords. In other words, the system admin can only verify if the password is correct but wonâ€™t know what the password submitted by the user was. On maintenance complaints, the cycleâ€™s information will be sent to the admin. The complainant usersâ€™ information is not sent to the server.
    \item \textbf{Secure Transactions}: Payment transactions within the software must be conducted through secure channels. The API of a safe payment gateway, like Razorpay, will be used for the same. A notification will be sent to the concerned people whenever a transaction is added.
    \item \textbf{Physical Security}: Implement physical security measures for any hardware components of the system to prevent unauthorized access. The cycle locks will only be opened when the user scans the QR code on the cycle.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Quality Attributes}
\subsubsection{Usability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Intuitiveness}: The software should have a user-friendly interface, allowing users to navigate through the rental process without confusion easily.
    \item \textbf{Response Time}: Provide quick response times for user interactions, such as renting a cycle or viewing available options.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Availability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In case of a server crash, the system state must be restored within two hours.
    \item \textbf{Performance Scalability}: The number of users will increase in large numbers during campus fests. The system availability needs to be enough for this purpose. Ensure the software can handle an increased load as the user base grows.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Reliability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The MTTF (mean time to failure) shall be more than one week.
    \item The system must undergo extensive feature testing, load testing, and regression testing prior to release and/or deployment.
    \item The system should be reliable in giving correct results consistently.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Portability}
We are using Django with bootstrap and inline CSS to design the front-end part of our application, thus our application is portable, responsive and can run on most of the modern web browsers.
