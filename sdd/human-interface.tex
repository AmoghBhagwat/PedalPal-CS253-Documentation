\subsubsection{Viewing Hubs and Booking a Ride}
The user sees a map which shows the location of the user along with the hubs present. They can either choose the hub on their map, or search it from the search box. Once a hub is selected, the details of the hub are displayed, including the number of available cycles. The user can choose to start a ride instantly, or book a cycle for a later time (available only for subscribed users). If the user wishes to book for later, they are presented with a time picker.

\subsubsection{Starting a Ride}
If the user wishes to ride instantly, they are presented with a QR code which they can scan to unlock the cycle. During the ride, statistics like ride time and current cost are shown to the user. Once the ride is over, the user can end the ride and the app will show the user the fare for the ride, and ask for feedback. The user can also report any issues with the cycle during the ride.

\subsubsection{Analytics and Wallet}
In the bookings page, users have access to both current and previous bookings, enabling them to track their activity. The history page provides users with a comprehensive overview of their ride history, detailing each ride's specifics. On the wallet page, users can monitor their balance and conveniently add funds to their wallet as needed.

\subsubsection{Admin Interface}
The admin interface serves as a control hub for managing both hubs and cycles. Admins possess the capability to introduce new hubs, inspect hub specifics, and regulate cycle operations. Furthermore, admins have access to comprehensive statistics, including total revenue metrics. They can also monitor user feedback and address reported issues effectively.
